Got it to print as a Neg. number when payments are added, but it is just superficial.

My reader is not able to differentiate Payments and Deposits, bc both are still Positive integers.

New Issue- It is not reading the previous inputs that are already in the file from before.

Does not display any of the Ledger screen properly.
Having troubles with reading from the file.
