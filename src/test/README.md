Got it to print as a Neg. number when payments are added, but it is just superficial.

My reader is not able to differentiate Payments and Deposits, bc both are still Positive integers.

Only displays All Transactions properly.

It does Display deposits, but pulls both deposit and payments


Might have to create new variables?
